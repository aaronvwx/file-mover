## Installation and Setup Instructions

**This program is made in Dutch.**

You can download the 3 files, but they need to be at the same destination. You can run the .py file on a code editor by choice, or command line.

## Reflection

This was the first year I got a programming class in Belgium, this was my thesis for my final year in High School. The task was to create the game 'Hangman' but I already made that before the teacher announced the task.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to move files from the download folder to another folder by looking at the extension. I expanded the program and now you can choose where you move files from. I added a log file to the program to see where your files went so you can track them down.

One of the main challenges I ran into was making a database in a txt file. You normally don't use a txt file for a database but at the time it seems the easiest.

After a year I looked back at this program and it looks afwull. I do not encourage people to write this bad code, there are many duplication codes in the program. Altough I wrote bad code, I'm extremely happy I did this project. It helped me get in love with programming and made my decision to study Computer Sciences to hopefully get a job in the United States.
